 
SOONER:
-------------------

some sort of generic 3d marker utility
3d axis indicators

fix resolution/buffer sizing and handle window resizes

building generator
	pedestals
	courtyards
	fences and walls
	

decal mesh generation
	triangle clipping
	terrain area stats

organize sampler namespace

fix text rendering and make it match pixel for pixel
clean up text rendering function
spaces in fonts don't work right
gui toolkit

standard base set of uniforms for all shaders (depends on #include partially)
rebuild eye/view code
calculate pixel position from inverse projection matrix in shading pass


proper terrain scaling (kinda done)
simplex noise (perlin artifacts look terrible)

implement real lighting

dummy textures

extrusion of a 2d shape along a spline
	perhaps the shape is a spline, allowing even better LoD

adjust shader log text for real line numbers
add #include support to shaders

add dragging support to input handling
build real input handling code


LATER:
--------------------

texture projection
fancy thin coverage-to-alpha wires

move view setup code to its own function

prevent zooming through the terrain

trees

mouse pointer cursors

error reporting on max_events being insufficient, possibly somethign to dump the queue

make all functions static that need to be

volumetric clouds and ground fog with projected translucent shadows

LOD tessellation on terrain
try to reuse color buffers for object picking to eliminate a dedicated selection buffer

particle system

fix lines
terrain texture blending

IDEAS:
--------------------
animated building demolitions
buildings should not change often, as in real life
day and night cycle
randomized building generator/customizer. swap out colors, fiddle with texture layering.
freeform park-as-a-zone, with auto layout generator
automatically generate residential yards and corporate parks
difficulty level multiplies water/electric usage, boosts crime, decreases economic demand
rain and clouds, should show in reflections
fog
destroyed buildings should fall into one another
fishing and hunting licenses
"football traffic"
tides
plant aspen and redwood as forest fire breaks
sieze forest lands and log for profit
a slider for strictness that police enforce the laws
circuit-breaker high tension towers
electrical substations
lightning problems
flower farms
sewers and storm drains


disasters:
flood
earthquake
huge raging fires
asteroid
volcano
riots, celebration riots
parades
rapture
toxic waste spill
parasite company that sucks the life out of people and takes over too much of the city, then fails
recession
pope/president visit
mudslides
hurricane
hipster infestation
gang/mafia wars
blizzard
oil spill
industrial accident explosions
unions/strikes
soccer riots
global economic meltdown
red dawn
tsunami
full apocalypse of john
health fad outbreak (gluten intolerance, atkins diet, etc)
collapse of socialism


power plants:
geothermal
wind
solar
tidal
coal and clean coal
lng
oil
garbage
nuclear
hydro dams
lignite/peat


metrics:
crime
air/water/ground pollution
noise
land value
dollars per sq ft for renting/leasing
red tape
sin
political activism
corruption
regulation
cost of living
consumer confidence
general niceness of area
local uniformity (you get dinged for putting a bunch of the same park in te same place)
bums
unemployment/jobs
civilian contempt for the government
nationalism


ordinances:
ban/regulate/tax gambling
ban/regulate/tax prostitution
ban/regulate/tax guns
ban/regulate/tax alcohol consumption
ban/regulate/tax alcohol production
business licenses
B&O taxes
sales taxes
property taxes
traffic fines
strictness of building codes
there should be a constant stream of pork-barrel petitioners trying to force people to buy their shit
plastic bag ban
car emissions
set default speed limit
lane splitting
drinking age
free wifi
B/R/T home gardens
B/R/T livestock
B/R/T pets
B/R/T home businesses
B/R/T a zillion different occupations
a million kinds of socialism
